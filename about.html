            <p>I am currently a Salesforce Administrator for the nonprofit organization Tech-Moms. I became involved with Salesforce after seeing the amazing benefits it had to offer as a Customer Relationship Management Software. I love that it benefits the largest global companies to the smallest local Mom and Pop shop, and truly enables their buisnesses and nonprofits to grow.
            </p>

            <p>My future goals are to be a Salesforce Consultant for multiple nonprofits, and to obtain my Salesforce Admin Certification this spring as well as my Nonprofit Superbadge on Trailhead</p>
            
            <p>I am the mother of 5 children, 4 dogs, two fish and am married to my highschool sweetheart, Hiro. I love being outdoors or in a bright sunny room! My hobbies include photography, skiing, snowboarding, swimming, hiking, gardening, and being with my family and those who bring joy to my life.
            </p>
            
            <p>I'm a sucker for Korean BBQ, Diet Coke with lime, fresh flowers, and a good book. Now that you know me, let's chat and see how I can help you.</p>
            
            <p>Kindest, Raka</p>
